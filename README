It seems to me that you can implement a much simpler CPS in javascript using the new `yield` operator... This would also work really well with promises, completely eliminating callback hell in one simple step... It also easily integrates into non-CPS code. If this is true, I think I just found something awesome.

I call this technique "Yield Passing Style", as it abuses `yield` to generate individual frames that are controlled with an explicit stack manager, giving me control over the stack and execution.

NOTE: Ok, so I implemented this and go it working, but it's too slow for any real world use. Seems like it kills the JIT. Still interesting though!
